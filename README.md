# Haskelloid
Yet another "implementation" of Asteroids -- For learning Haskell

 - Initial version `asteroid.hs` just to get going.
 - Has the basic dynamics but I now want to explode the 
 spaceship when it's hit by an asteroid. 
 - The `World s as ms` is a bit rigid, I want a more variable
 world (UFO ?).
 - I'm reading about Entity-systems. Not sure if it's really relevant
 for a tiny single player game, but what the hell.
